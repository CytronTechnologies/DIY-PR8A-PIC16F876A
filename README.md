# RFID : Read & Display
Sample source code for DIY PR8A. Project description : PR8 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface with RFID-IDR-232 and 16x2 LCD. It shows the method to modify commercial RDIF reader to interface with microcontroller through UART. It can further be modified to become security system.

There is a folder of Source code(.c and .hex). Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
