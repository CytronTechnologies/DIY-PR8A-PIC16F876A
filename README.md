# RFID : Read & Display
Sample source code for DIY PR8A. Project description : PR8 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface with RFID-IDR-232 and 16x2 LCD. It shows the method to modify commercial RDIF reader to interface with microcontroller through UART. It can further be modified to become security system.Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
